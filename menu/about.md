title: About Noelma!
---

I have a Literature major and a master in the same field, as well as specializations in Distance Learning and Technology & Knowledge management. In the last 20+ years I've been acting as a publisher, mainly in the areas of science, engineering and administration. At the moment I'm taking and specialization in data science and machine learning.

Here you'll find my projects, experiements in this new field and sometimes few off-topic stuff.

Enjoy!
